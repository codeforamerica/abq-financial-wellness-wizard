ABQs Financial Wellness Resource Wizard
===============================

This is an early prototype of our Financial Wellness Evaluation form. 

##Here are some examples of the questions that are asked:

####Q: What is your level of financial stress?
####A: Not Stressed

####Q: What do you worry about more, paying bills regularly or saving money for a rainy day or big purchase?
####A: Paying Bills

####Q: How often do you miss a bill payment?
####A: Never

The wizard will then hopefully sort a list accordingly.(hosted here: https://github.com/codeforamerica/abq-financial-services-directory)
