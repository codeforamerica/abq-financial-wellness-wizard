ABQs Financial Wellness Resource Wizard
===============================
Check out our prototype [here] (http://codeforamerica.github.io/abq-financial-wellness-wizard/)

This is a prototype application created by the City of Albuquerque Code for America Fellows. It helps people understand their own financial wellness by giving them an evaluation and using that data to generate a report and recommendations as to what things to do to help you grow financially.

===============================

#Deploying this application:

In order to deploy this code you will need to install the Jekyll gem through your command line with `gem install jekyll` (you need Ruby 2.0.0 installed to run this gem).

Once you've done that you should simply be able to run the Jekyll command `jekyll serve` or `jekyll serve --watch` and see the site hosted on your localhost:4000 (with `--watch` it will listen for updates).

For further documentation on using Jekyll you can go to <a href="http://www.jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyllrb.com</a>.
